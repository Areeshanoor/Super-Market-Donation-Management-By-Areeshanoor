# Supermarket  Donation Management System

## Overview

This Python program is designed to help the manager of a supermarket track donations to charities. Each customer has the option to choose one of three charities, and 1% of their shopping bill will be donated to the selected charity. The program records and totals donations, allowing the manager to view the contributions made to each charity.

## Tasks

### Task 1 – Set up the donation system

- Input and store the names of three charities.
- Display the charity names with corresponding numbers (1, 2, or 3).
- Allow the user to choose a charity (1, 2, or 3).
- Input the value of a customer's shopping bill.
- Calculate the donation.
- Initialize three totals to zero for each charity.

### Task 2 – Record and total each donation

- Input the customer's charity choice (1, 2, or 3).
- Input the value of the customer's shopping bill.
- Calculate the donation based on the bill amount.
- Add the donation to the appropriate charity's total.
- Output the name of the charity and the amount donated.

### Task 3 – Show the totals so far

- Extend Task 2 to accept donations from more customers.
- Allow a charity choice of -1 to show the totals so far.
- Display the charities' names and the totals in descending order of donations.
- Calculate and display the grand total of all three charities.


## Testing

Ensure the program's reliability by testing various scenarios, including valid and invalid inputs. Verify that the program calculates donations accurately and displays totals correctly.
